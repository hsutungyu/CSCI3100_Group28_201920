<a>After finding the product you decided to buy, you may put it in the shopping cart. </a><br>
<a>If you finished shopping, proceed to checkout! </a><br>
<a>You can choose either pay at pick up or pay by FPS. </a><br>
<a>If you want to pay at pick up, you need to arrange pick up time and venue in "message" with the seller. </a><br>
<a>If you pay by FPS, wait for the confirmation of payment after using the FPS system, then arrange pick up time and venue with the seller.</a><br>
<a>In either case, remember to confirm the transaction finished to ensure no scamming. Enjoy your shopping with Trade2CU!</a>
