<h2 style="text-align:center">About Creators</h2>

<p>We are a team of CUHK students who found that many CUHK students, teachers and staffs suffer from different kinds of inconvenience. One of the biggest inconvenience is to dispose of something which is not useful for the original owner while still valuable. Secondly, some students may be facing financial difficulties so that they would prefer second-hand items, such as textbooks and dorm items, to whole new items. However, it is always hard to find a specific second-hand item. Therefore, we aim to provide a platform for users to conveniently search for items that they are interested in, to promote a more friendly atmosphere between individuals of CUHK and to minimize the amount of wasted items that are created in CUHK.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">About Trade2CU</h2>
